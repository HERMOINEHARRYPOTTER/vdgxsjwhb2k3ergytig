go go go 
Time to go to school
Ding ding ding ding ding!

The alarm clock goes off exactly at 
824
, waking up the 
fat
 girl.

Time to 
swim
 and get ready for 
toothbrush
!

First she 
hiked
 breakfast. Then she brushes her 
butterfly
. Finally, she puts on her shoes.

Ready to go!

Carrying her 
elavator
 in case of 
sweat shirt
, she 
adroitly
 walks out to the 
chicken
 and waits for the 
noun
.

Today is going to be a good day! She's excited to learn: mathematics, 
astrology
, grammar, and 
useless Divion
. Not to mention recess!

She can't wait to see her 
sunglasses
 and tell them about the 
dark
 
lyirc
 she did yesterday.
 
 # Halloween story
 
 The jack o lantern found a magic wand, and cast "smelliarmus" on the wizard kids.  Then he puked up a bottle of firewhiskey.
